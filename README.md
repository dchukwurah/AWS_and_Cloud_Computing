### What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing is **the delivery of computing services over the Internet ("the cloud")** to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale. Users typically pay only for the cloud services they use, helping lower operating costs, run infrastructure more efficiently, and scale as the business needs change.
- Services include:
- Servers
- Storage
- Databases
- Networking
- Software 
- Analytics
- Intelligence

### Quick History/Timeline of Cloud Computing:

1. **1960s**: The idea of an "intergalactic computer network" was introduced by J.C.R. Licklider, leading to the development of ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network).
2. **1970s**: The concept of virtual machines (VMs) was developed, allowing multiple operating systems to run on a single physical system.
3. **1990s**: Telecommunications companies started offering virtualized private network connections.
4. **2002**: Amazon launched Amazon Web Services (AWS), providing a suite of cloud-based services.
5. **2006**: Amazon introduced the Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2).
6. **2008**: Google launched the Google App Engine, and Microsoft launched Azure.
7. **2010s**: The rise of big data analytics and the Internet of Things (IoT) further boosted the adoption of cloud computing.

### What Can You Do with Cloud Computing?

1. **Data Backup and Storage**: Store, back up, and recover data.
2. **Web Hosting**: Host websites and blogs.
3. **Streaming**: Deliver content to a global audience.
4. **Software on Demand**: Use software without installation (SaaS).
5. **Data Analysis**: Analyze data for patterns and insights.
6. **Machine Learning and AI**: Train AI models.
7. **Virtual Desktops**: Access your desktop anywhere.

### What is “On-Prem”?

"On-Prem" or "On-Premises" refers to infrastructure and software that is physically located within an organization's premises, rather than being hosted on the cloud. It's the traditional model where companies own and maintain their own data centers.

### What are the 4 TYPES of Cloud?

1. **Public Cloud**: Owned and operated by third-party cloud service providers, and the resources are shared among multiple users.
2. **Private Cloud**: Used exclusively by a single organization. It can be hosted on-premises or by a third-party provider.
3. **Hybrid Cloud**: Combines public and private clouds, allowing data and applications to be shared between them.
4. **Community Cloud**: Shared by several organizations with common concerns.

### What are the Different Types of Cloud SERVICE?

1. **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)**: Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet.
2. **PaaS (Platform as a Service)**: Provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications.
3. **SaaS (Software as a Service)**: Delivers software applications over the internet on a subscription basis.

### Advantages/Disadvantages of the Cloud for a Business:

**Advantages**:
1. Cost Efficiency: No need to invest in and maintain physical infrastructure.
2. Scalability: Easily scale up or down based on demand.
3. Flexibility: Access resources from anywhere.
4. Disaster Recovery: Easier backup and recovery solutions.

**Disadvantages**:
1. Security Concerns: Potential for data breaches.
2. Downtime: Dependence on service providers.
3. Limited Control: Over infrastructure and software updates.
4. Data Transfer Costs: Especially for large amounts of data.

### What is OpEx vs CapEx?

**OpEx (Operating Expense)**: Day-to-day/short-term expense - These are expenses that a business incurs through its normal business operations. They are short-term expenses and are fully tax-deductible.

**CapEx (Capital Expense)**: Long-term expense -These are long-term investments in the business. They are used to acquire, upgrade, or maintain physical assets.

In the context of IT, moving to the cloud often shifts costs from CapEx (investing in physical servers) to OpEx (monthly cloud service fees).

### Marketshare - What is the Breakdown?

AWS holds the largest market share, followed by Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform. However, the exact percentages can vary based on the source and can change over time.

### What are the 3 Largest Cloud Providers Known for?

1. **AWS (Amazon Web Services)**: Known for its vast array of services, global presence, and being the pioneer in cloud services.
2. **Microsoft Azure**: Known for its integration with Microsoft's software products and its enterprise-friendly offerings.
3. **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**: Known for its strong offerings in data analytics, machine learning, and open source technologies.

### What are the 4 Pillars of DevOps? How Do They Link into the Cloud?

The four pillars of DevOps are:
1. **Culture**: Promoting a collaborative environment.
2. **Automation**: Automating manual processes.
3. **Measurement**: Using metrics and feedback to improve processes.
4. **Sharing**: Sharing feedback and best practices.

The cloud complements DevOps by providing on-demand resources, automation tools, and scalability, making it easier to implement DevOps practices.
