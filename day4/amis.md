# AMI - amazon machine image
# same concept as disk images 
# go to actions in instance and create an image - DO NOT CREATE a Template
# Instance volume means it will store it in a volume 
# default storage types are EBS IBS etc, you can change the size here but for our purposes there is no size change

# AMIs and scripts together for better version control and auto-scaling
